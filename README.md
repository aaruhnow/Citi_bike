# NYC Bike-Sharing Analysis

## Objective  
As the lead analyst for a bike-sharing service in New York City, this project aims to analyze user behavior to help the business strategy team optimize bike distribution across the city. By conducting a descriptive analysis of existing data, we seek actionable insights to mitigate availability issues and maintain the company’s leadership in eco-friendly transportation.

## Context  
The popularity of **Citi Bike** has grown significantly since its launch in 2013, with demand surging even more during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this growth has led to **distribution challenges**, such as:  
- Low bike availability at popular stations  
- Overcrowded docks making it difficult to return bikes  
- Increased customer complaints  

By diagnosing the root causes of these issues—whether they stem from supply constraints, seasonal demand fluctuations, or other factors—we will provide data-driven solutions to improve Citi Bike’s logistics strategy.

## Data and Tools  
For this project, we will analyze open-source data from **Citi Bike (2022)** and enrich it with **weather data from NOAA’s API**. The following tools and libraries will be used:  
- **Data Analysis & Processing:** `pandas`, `NumPy`  
- **Visualization & Mapping:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, `Kepler.gl`  
- **Dashboard Development:** `Streamlit`  

## Analysis Approach  
The analysis will focus on:  
- Aggregating **bike trip data** to identify the most popular starting locations and seasonal patterns.  
- Using **geographic plotting** to highlight problem areas in station distribution and common travel routes.  

## Visualization & Dashboard  
A **Python-powered interactive dashboard** will present key findings, featuring:  
- **A structured layout** with an introduction, individual slides for each visualization, and a final recommendation page.  
- **Visually refined graphs** using a well-defined color palette.  
- **Insights tailored for business stakeholders**, ensuring clarity for non-technical audiences.  

## Success Factors  
- Deliver a **clear, interactive dashboard** showcasing all distribution challenges.  
- Provide **visual insights** into factors affecting demand and bike availability.  
- Present **strategic recommendations** and actionable next steps for business improvements.
